A refactoring tool for converting Python 2.x code to 3.0.

This is a work in progress!

Files:

README         - this file
test.py        - runs all unittests for 2to3
patcomp.py     - pattern compiler
pytree.py      - parse tree nodes (not specific to Python, despite the name!)
pygram.py      - code specific to the Python grammar
example.py     - example input for play.py and fix_*.py
Grammar.txt    - Python grammar input (a copy of Python 2.5's Grammar/Grammar)
Grammar.pickle - pickled grammar tables (generated file, not in subversion)
PatternGrammar.txt    - grammar for the pattern language used by patcomp.py
PatternGrammar.pickle - pickled pattern grammar tables (generated file)
pgen2/         - Parser generator and driver (1) (2)
fixes/         - Individual transformations
tests/         - Test files for pytree, fixers, grammar, etc


Notes:

(1) I modified tokenize.py to yield a NL pseudo-token for backslash
    continuations, so the original source can be reproduced exactly.
    The modified version can be found at pgen2/tokenize.py.
(2) I developed pgen2 while I was at Elemental Security.  I modified
    it while at Google to suit the needs of this refactoring tool.

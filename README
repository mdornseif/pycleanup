A refactoring tool for converting Python 2.x code to 3.0.

This is a work in progress!

Files:

README         - this file
play.py        - program to exercise the idempotency of pytree nodes
tests.py       - unit tests for pytree.py
patcomp.py     - pattern compiler
pytree.py      - parse tree nodes (not specific to Python, despite the name!)
pygram.py      - code specific to the Python grammar
tokenize.py    - modified version of stdlib tokenize.py (1)
example.py     - example input for play.py and fix_*.py
Grammar.txt    - Python grammar input (a copy of Python 2.5's Grammar/Grammar)
Grammar.pickle - pickled grammar tables (generated file, not in subversion)
PatternGrammar.txt    - grammar for the pattern language used by patcomp.py
PatternGrammar.pickle - pickled pattern grammar tables (generated file)
pgen2/         - Parser generator and driver (2)
fixes/         - Individual transformations

Notes:

(1) I modified tokenize.py to yield a NL pseudo-token for backslash
    continuations, so the original source can be reproduced exactly.
(2) I developed pgen2 while I was at Elemental Security.  I modified
    it while at Google to suit the needs of this refactoring tool.

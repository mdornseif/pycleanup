A refactoring tool for converting Python 2.x code to 3.0.

This is a prototype!

Files:

play.py        - test program
pynode.py      - parse tree nodes for Python grammar
tokenize.py    - modified version of stdlib tokenize.py (1)
fix_has_key.py - refactoring tool changing 'x.has_key(y)' into 'y in x'
example.py     - example input
Grammar.txt    - Grammar input (same as Grammar/Grammar in Python 2.5)
Grammar.pickle - Pickled grammar tables
pgen2/         - Parser generator and driver (2)

Notes:

(1) tokenize.py was modified to yield a NL pseudo-token for backslash
    continuations, so the original source can be reproduced exactly.
(2) pgen2 was developed while I was at Elemental Security.  It was
    modified to suit the needs of this refactoring tool.

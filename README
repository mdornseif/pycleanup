Abstract
========

A refactoring tool for converting Python 2.x code to 3.0.

This is a work in progress!

Capabilities
============

A quick run-through of 2to3's current fixers:

* **fix_apply** - convert apply() calls to real function calls.

* **fix_dict** - fix up dict.keys(), .values(), .items() and their iterator
  versions.
  
* **fix_except** - adjust "except" statements to Python 3 syntax (PEP 3110).

* **fix_exec** - convert "exec" statements to exec() function calls.

* **fix_has_key** - "d.has_key(x)" -> "x in d".

* **fix_input** - "input()" -> "eval(input())" (PEP 3111).

* **fix_intern** - "intern(x)" -> "sys.intern(x)".

* **fix_long** - remove all usage of explicit longs in favor of ints.

* **fix_ne** - convert the "<>" operator to "!=".

* **fix_next** - fixer for it.next() -> next(it) (PEP 3114).

* **fix_nonzero** - convert __nonzero__() methods to __bool__() methods.

* **fix_numliterals** - tweak certain numeric literals to be 3.0-compliant.

* **fix_print** - convert "print" statements to print() function calls.

* **fix_raise** - convert "raise" statements to Python 3 syntax (PEP 3109).

* **fix_raw_input** - "raw_input()" -> "input()" (PEP 3111).

* **fix_repr** - swap backticks for repr() calls.

* **fix_sysexcinfo** - warn on usage of sys.value, sys.type and
  sys.traceback.

* **fix_throw** - fix generator.throw() calls to be 3.0-compliant (PEP 3109).

* **fix_tuple_params** - remove tuple parameters from function, method and
  lambda declarations (PEP 3113).
  
* **fix_xrange** - "xrange()" -> "range()".


Limitations
===========

General Limitations
-------------------

* In general, fixers that convert a function or method call will not detect
  something like ::

      a = apply
      a(f, *args)
    
  or ::

      m = d.has_key
      if m(5):
          ...
        
* Fixers that look for attribute references will not detect when getattr() or
  setattr() is used to access those attributes.
  
* The contents of eval() calls and "exec" statements will not be checked by
  2to3.

        
Caveats for Specific Fixers
---------------------------

fix_except
''''''''''

"except" statements like ::

    except Exception, (a, b):
        ...

are not fixed up. The ability to treat exceptions as sequences is being
removed in Python 3, so there is no straightforward, automatic way to
adjust these statements.

This is seen frequently when dealing with OSError.


fix_has_key
'''''''''''

While the primary target of this fixer is dict.has_key(), the
fixer will change any has_key() method call, regardless of what class it
belongs to. Anyone using non-dictionary classes with has_key() methods is
advised to pay close attention when using this fixer.


fix_raise
'''''''''

"raise E, V" will be incorrectly translated if V is an exception instance.
The correct Python 3 idiom is ::
   
    raise E from V
        
but since we can't detect instance-hood by syntax alone and since any client
code would have to be changed as well, we don't automate this.


Notes
=====

.. [#1] I modified tokenize.py to yield a NL pseudo-token for backslash
        continuations, so the original source can be reproduced exactly.
        The modified version can be found at pgen2/tokenize.py.

.. [#2] I developed pgen2 while I was at Elemental Security.  I modified
        it while at Google to suit the needs of this refactoring tool.


Development
===========

The HACKING file has a list of TODOs -- some simple, some complex -- that
would make good introductions for anyone new to 2to3.

Tips/tricks/hints for writing new fixers:

    * Don't write your own PATTERN from scratch; that's what find_pattern.py
      is for.
    
    * If your fixer works by changing a node's children list or a leaf's
      value, be sure to call the node/leaf's changed() method. This to
      be sure refactor.py will recognize that the tree has changed.

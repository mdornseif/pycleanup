Tips/tricks/hints for writing new fixers:

    * Don't write your own PATTERN from scratch; that's what find_pattern.py
      is for.
    
    * If your fixer works by changing a node's children list or a leaf's
      value, be sure to call the node/leaf's changed() method. This to
      be sure refactor.py will recognize that the tree has changed.



TODO

    Simple:
    #######
    
    * Refactor common code out of fixes/fix_*.py into fixes.util (ongoing).


    Complex:
    ########
    
    * Replace tuple usage in patterns and node.children with lists (95%
        done). Simplify fixers accordingly (mostly done, I think).

    * Come up with a scheme to hide the details of suite indentation (some
        kind of custom pytree node for suites, probably). This will
        automatically reindent all code with spaces, tied into a refactor.py
        flag that allows you to specify the indent level.

    * Remove the need to explicitly assign a node's parent attribute.
